=Tricss Specs

This folder contains JSSpecs, a test suite to check functionality.

The folder structure is similar to the structure of Source/.

All files are prefixed with "Spec.".

==Test Cases

The file index.html runs tests all files in Source/. minified.html tests only the Core, but uses the minified version generated by the Builder.
